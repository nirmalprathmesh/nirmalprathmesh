## 🧠 About Me
<img align="right" width="200" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74038190/229223263-cf2e4b07-2615-4f87-9c38-e37600f8381a.gif">


I am currently pursuing a degree in **Artificial Intelligence & Data Science**, focused on developing the skills required to engineer real-world intelligent systems.

My primary interest lies in understanding how data can be transformed into predictive power and actionable intelligence.

Instead of limiting myself to coursework, I actively build projects that strengthen my ability to:

✔️ Think analytically  
✔️ Design machine learning solutions  
✔️ Work with real datasets  
✔️ Solve meaningful problems  

My mission is simple:

> **Become an engineer capable of building systems that people trust and depend on.**

## 🚀 Current Trajectory

🔹 Data Analysis & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
🔹 Statistical Thinking for Data-Driven Decisions  
🔹 Machine Learning Algorithms & Model Evaluation  
🔹 Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing  
🔹 Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation   
🔹 Strengthening Data Structures & Algorithms for problem-solving  

I am intentionally focusing on **depth over hype technologies.**
