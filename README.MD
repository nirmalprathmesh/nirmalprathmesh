## 🧠 About Me

I am currently pursuing a degree in **Artificial Intelligence & Data Science**, focused on developing the skills required to engineer real-world intelligent systems.

My primary interest lies in understanding how data can be transformed into predictive power and actionable intelligence.

Instead of limiting myself to coursework, I actively build projects that strengthen my ability to:

✔️ Think analytically  
✔️ Design machine learning solutions  
✔️ Work with real datasets  
✔️ Solve meaningful problems  

My mission is simple:

> **Become an engineer capable of building systems that people trust and depend on.**

---

## 🚀 Current Trajectory

🔹 Machine Learning & Model Optimization  
🔹 Large Language Models (LLMs)  
🔹 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
🔹 Data Structures & Algorithms  
🔹 Writing scalable, production-style Python  

I am intentionally focusing on **depth over hype technologies.**

## 🛠 Technical Arsenal

### Languages

Python • C++


**Environment & Tools**
Git • GitHub • Jupyter Notebook • VS Code

### Selected Work

🧠 **RAG-Based AI Teaching Assistant**  
Designed an intelligent system that helps students locate exact concepts inside lecture videos using semantic retrieval and language models.

→ Demonstrates applied LLM knowledge and system thinking.

---

📊 **California Housing Price Prediction**  
Built a regression model using real-world housing data to estimate property values.

→ Applied data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

---

### Growth Mindset

I strongly believe that consistency beats talent.

Every project I build is a step toward becoming a highly capable engineer who can:

✔️ Understand complex data  
✔️ Design intelligent solutions  
✔️ Ship real systems  

Not just notebooks.
