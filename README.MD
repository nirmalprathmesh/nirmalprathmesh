### Who Am I?

I am a second-year Computer Science student driven by curiosity and the desire to understand **how intelligent systems think**.

Rather than just learning theory, I focus on building projects that challenge me to grow — from predictive models to AI-powered applications.

My long-term goal is simple:

👉 **Build data-driven systems that people actually rely on.**

---

### What I’m Focused On Right Now

- Machine Learning fundamentals  
- Large Language Models (LLMs)  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- Data Structures & Algorithms  
- Writing cleaner, production-style Python  

---

### Technical Toolkit

**Languages**
Python • C++


**Environment & Tools**
Git • GitHub • Jupyter Notebook • VS Code

### Selected Work

🧠 **RAG-Based AI Teaching Assistant**  
Designed an intelligent system that helps students locate exact concepts inside lecture videos using semantic retrieval and language models.

→ Demonstrates applied LLM knowledge and system thinking.

---

📊 **California Housing Price Prediction**  
Built a regression model using real-world housing data to estimate property values.

→ Applied data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

---

### Growth Mindset

I strongly believe that consistency beats talent.

Every project I build is a step toward becoming a highly capable engineer who can:

✔️ Understand complex data  
✔️ Design intelligent solutions  
✔️ Ship real systems  

Not just notebooks.

---

### 2026 Targets

- Develop deep intuition for Machine Learning  
- Publish multiple high-quality projects  
- Contribute to meaningful technical work  
- Earn a Data Science / ML internship  
- Transition from student → practitioner
